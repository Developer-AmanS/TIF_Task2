BUG REPORT

1. The name of component FormWrapper was written as FromWrapper in FormInput Component and FormSelect Component
2. The dropdown menu were overlapping the immediate element in FormSelect Component. Rectified by introducing MenuPortalTarget, MenuPosition on ReactSelect and the adjusting the custom styles for "option" where isFocused was used.
3. The next button did not work in Job Section due to an extra validation which had to be removed
4. There was a name error in HomeLayout Component where RequisitionForms was written instead of RequisitionDetailsForm.
5. HomeLayout component had a DisplayCard component ,renamed it to PreviewCard as no such component existed
6. Changed label from Job Location to Interview Language in InterViewSettingsForm Component



The interview section has been validated
